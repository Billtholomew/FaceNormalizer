# FaceNormalizer
Simple face normalizer

Still working on finding face points reliably. It finds the eyes and the face under what seems to be pristine circumstances.
The false positive rate seems very low, but this comes at the cost of a huge false negative rate.
Right now it works using webcams, mostly for ease of testing, but since camera quality is low, it doesn't always find face boundaries well.
